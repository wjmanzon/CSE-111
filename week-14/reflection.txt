Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

This semester, I worked on my final project, gpa.py. Its purpose is to calculate
and forecast the student's GPA. While working on my project, the question on my mind
was how to divide the a big function into smaller functions so that the function will do
only one thing. I figured out that all of the inputs can be put in the main, and then just
pass in those inputs as arguments to the other functions, let the other functions process
the inputs, and then return values.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Test functions allow us to test the functions without the need of running the program
and printing the results in the terminal again and again. It saves us time and energy.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
When there's a problem with my code, I look at the terminal and read the error message.
When the error message is not familiar to me, I search for it in Google and find solution.
When I know what the error is, I look at the line of code and use the debugging tool in VS code
to know where the glitch is happening, and solve it from there.
When I cannot solve it by myself, I turn to my groupmate for help.
